# Industry Talk 2

This talk was a major reality check. It completely shifted my perspective on what it means to be a "tech professional." I used to think programming was the only thing that mattered, but I’ve realized that systems thinking and planning are the actual foundations of any successful project. Seeing a complex concept like the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) explained through everyday tasks like cooking or enrolling in school made it click—it’s not just about technical jargon; it’s about a logical, repeatable process.

Waterfall vs. Agile: Choosing the Right Tool
The comparison between methodologies was particularly helpful in understanding how the industry actually operates:
- Waterfall: Like a rigid blueprint. It’s linear and steady, which works if you know exactly where you’re going from start to finish.
- Agile: Like a GPS that reroutes in real-time. It’s built for the messy reality of changing requirements and constant feedback.

##The Human Element & AI
The speaker also hammered home a point we often forget in tech: communication is a technical skill. Since most industrial projects are team-based, being able to explain your ideas is just as vital as writing the code itself.
We also touched on the "elephant in the room"—AI tools like ChatGPT. The takeaway was clear: AI should be a co-pilot, not the pilot. It’s there to boost productivity, but it can’t replace the fundamental knowledge we’re building right now. In short, this talk was a great motivator to stop focusing solely on syntax and start mastering the "big picture" skills—teamwork, process planning, and clear communication—that actually define a career.
