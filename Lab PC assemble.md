# Lab PC assemble
Date : 30 October 2025

## Reflection 

This class exicte me because we finally moved our learning off the page and into our hands. We’ve spent plenty of time reading about PC parts in textbooks and watching videos online, but actually taking a computer apart and rebuilding it was a completely different experience.
The biggest challenge? Cable management. It was a lesson in patience and precision—having to carefully match tiny connectors to the correct motherboard pins while following a manual was much harder than it looks on a screen.

Key Takeaways:
- Theory vs. Practice: Seeing the internal components in person made the technical diagrams finally make sense.
- Precision: I learned that building hardware requires a meticulous, detail-oriented approach.
- Teamwork: Working in groups helped us troubleshoot and double-check our connections together.

Big thanks to Dr. Aryati for this unique opportunity. It’s one thing to know how a computer works, but it’s another thing entirely to be the one who puts it together.
