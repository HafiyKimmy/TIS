# UTM Digital Open Day vlog

My visit to UTMDigital provide a valuable transition from classroom theory to practical application. While lectures introduced the fundamentals of databases and networking, the site visit offered a firsthand look at how cloud computing and cybersecurity maintain the integrity of a digital enterprise. 

Beyond the technical scope, this experience directly aligned with our team mission of improving social skills and building genuine connections. Engaging in professional interviews and collaborating on a video production pushed us outside our comfort zones, demonstrating that successful system development relies heavily on team synergy and open communication. 

Ultimately, this journey reinforced the idea that technical expertise, when paired with strong soft skills and a supportive network, is the true catalyst for professional opportunity.
