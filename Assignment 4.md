# Industry Talk 3
Data Analytics is like baking the perfect dessert! 🍰📊 I recently attended an insightful session on the Information Systems behind Power BI with Qaisara Rohzan from PPG. The highlight was the "Dessert Analogy" for data pipelines—mapping raw data sources as "ingredients," warehousing as the "freezer," and Power BI as the "chef." As a Data Engineering student, this end-to-end view perfectly illustrated how critical backend architecture is to the final "flavor" of a business report. Huge thanks to the organizers for such a creative and valuable session!
