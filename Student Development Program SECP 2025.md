# SECP Student Development Program 2025

On November 8, 2025, I get to join the SECP Student Development Program 2025 that was organized by the faculty. It was open to all SECP students, from Year 1 to Year 3. As a first-year Computer Science student, this program was very meaningful and motivating because it helped me gain a clearer understanding of what I should focus on throughout my university life beyond just getting good grades.
