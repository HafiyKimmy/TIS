# SECP Student Development Program 2025

On November 8, 2025, I get to join the SECP Student Development Program 2025 that was organized by the faculty. It was open to all SECP students, from Year 1 to Year 3. As a first-year Computer Science student, this program was very meaningful and motivating because it helped me gain a clearer understanding of what I should focus on throughout my university life beyond just getting good grades.

The morning started with a talk by Mr. Baharudin Mastari, the Senior Deputy Registrar for the Faculty of Computing at UTM. He broke down the main qualities UTM wants in its graduates,not just academic results but strong leadership, communication skills, teamwork, and strong ethics. Before this, I’ll admit, my main goal was just to pass my classes and do well in exams. But after listening to him, I realized grades are just one part of the story. I need to put time into building my soft skills too, not just my technical ones.

After that, we continue the talk from Ms. Noor Hazwani Ramli who is a PETRONAS executive and also the CEO and founder of GetMeHired. She talked about how companies use Applicant Tracking System (ATS) to filter resumes. Honestly, I didn’t know much about this before. I learned that your resume needs to be clear and straightforward so that the system can read it and not the fancy infographics and creative designs resume. Her tips made me rethink how I’ll write my resume when the time comes.

We also had a session with senior students in their final year, which really stuck with me. They encouraged us to join competitions like hackathons, even if we feel underprepared or inexperienced. I used to think I had to master everything before trying these things. Turns out, you learn as you go. These competitions aren’t just for showing off what you know,they’re for picking up new skills, getting used to real-world challenges, and building up your confidence.

Looking back, I’m grateful that I joined this program. It gave me a better sense of where I should head as a Data Engineering student. Now, I feel more motivated to work on both my technical and soft skills, get involved in activities outside the classroom, and really make the most of my time at university. It’s not just about passing the exams with flying colours but it’s also about preparing for what comes next.
