# PPG Industry Talk Poster

The session with PPG Industries was eye-opening because it challenged the idea that IT is just about writing code. Seeing how the Data Analytics, Cloud, and SAP teams collaborate across different countries made me realize how massive the digital backbone of a multinational corporation really is. It wasn't just about theory; hearing how SAP connects every part of a business—from logistics to finance—showed me exactly why technology is the "make or break" factor for a company's global success.

The most valuable takeaway for me was the breakdown of IT roles. It was a reminder that I don’t have to be "just" a software developer; there is a huge demand for expertise in:
- Data Engineering (handling real-world, messy data)
- Cloud Management (keeping global services running)
- Cybersecurity & ERP (protecting and connecting the business)

Learning that PPG prioritizes mentorship and global internship projects makes the transition from university to the workplace feel much more attainable. This talk didn't just give me information; it gave me a roadmap for the skills I need to sharpen—like SQL and cloud architecture—to be ready for the industry. It’s one thing to study these concepts in a classroom, but seeing them drive a global business makes me much more eager to start my own career journey.
